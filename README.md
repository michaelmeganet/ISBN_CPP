# ISBN_CPP
The C++ program Book Information System

This application using C++ that allows user to store information of 100 books published
from year 1900 onwards. Information for every book to be captured include title, ISBN and
year published. Book title has length constraint of 50 characters. ISBN is either 10 or 13
characters in length. Year published is expressed in full 4-digit.
When the application starts, it scans in the same directory for a data file named "file.dat". The
data file, if exists, contains fixed-length records of books that have been entered previously. If
there are more than 100 records in the data file, the application will only read the first 100
book records. When the application exits, all book information that have been entered by user
will be saved into the "file3.dat" file, overwriting all existing data in the file.

1) All input constraints are properly handled and error/warning messages shown if these
constraints are violated
2) Use of at least THREE (3) user-defined classes
